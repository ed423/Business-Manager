# E-Commerce Business Expense Tracker

## Project Summary

This application is a **business expense/budget tracker**. It tracks a business':

* Account balance
* Revenue
* Profit
* Expenses

This application is aimed at small businesses hosted online or partially online, as running an online business involves
a tremendous amount of effort to succeed. As an e-commerce business owner myself, I have found that the task of managing
financial resources is a daunting at times. I would like to have the ability to keep track of the inflow and outflow of 
finances in a simple manner, without having to decrease profits by hiring an employee to do so.
